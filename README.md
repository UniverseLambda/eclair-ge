# Eclair - A hobby project to reimplement Blitz3D

## Overview

In this project, there's two components:
- ege-compiler: the BlitzBasic compiler (eclairc)
- ege-runtime: the engine per se (with all the code that the ouput of eclairc uses to create windows, print stuff, etc...)

### Requirements

You need llvm installed (currently tested with llvm 12 and llvm 18, so those are the only ones working right now).

### What does 'ege' mean?

Eclair Game Engine.

I'm a simple man.

Unlike my code, which is a nameless mess.

### Why?

Because I'm bored and like big projects.

And because I love SCP: Containment Breach. So this game engine will be primarly tested against it.

## TODO

- code generation
- window management
- drawing basic things (like shapes)
- fonts
- input management
- shaders (for bump mapping, etc...)
- a proper README.md
- tests
- fill this list
- re-order this list by priority
- empty this list
